# Create-basic-Rest-API-using-Node.js-
In here you will find documented code for making a basic REST API using Node.js. (GET,POST methods) using Express framework.
I have also added how to serve simple html files , now we can mix the concepts of all these three files and some middlewares to make 
a proper web app.

This is actually how I learnt creating API's for the first time.
## piece of cake.
